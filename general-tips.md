# General Tips for Taking the Exam

## What skills does this test want you to know?

This is an English test. This test is for a security manager. You have to analyze scope, time, and cost for most questions. Your goal is to reduce the risk

## Reading and understanding the question

Read the question and answers twice. Skim the question and answers. Then go back and read it carefully. Argue with each of the answers. Does this answer work? It meets all requirements in question? Are any other answers more efficient for time and cost?

## Quantitative, Qualitative, nouns, verbs, processes, technologies

If you have no idea what the answer is, you can generally eliminate at least two answers from the language in the question. The question could be asking for a technology, and two of the answers are processes. The test could want an action and 1 of the answers is a noun.

* Accuracy = correct

## Human life and risk

## Speed

Take practices tests and time yourself. You need to take your time and not have to worry about rushing. You must be focused only on answering the questions. If you are taking too long on your practice tests, then adjust yourself. You are also not going to know several test questions, so do your best, eliminate as many as you can, and move on.

## Failure

Now I'm not going to be your life coach, but your mind is capable of incredible things. I believe that you can learn anything as long as you don't put up any mental barriers or excuses for yourself. That being said, studying is hard, this test is hard, life is hard. You must appreciate all that you do in life, do your best, and be happy with it. Get back up and keep trying if this certification is your priority.
