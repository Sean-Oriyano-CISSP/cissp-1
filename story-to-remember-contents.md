# Short story to remember all of the contents of the CISSP material. If your brain can map information

## This will only work for me because I'm remembering this happening in a long term memory location

I walk outside my door to see the CIA. They have my DAD and want my \(AAA\). They recorded my statement so there was NONREPUDIATION. They said I didn't NEED TO KNOW anymore more information. There were legal issues to follow, but they had to remain COMPLIANT to the law. I then walked over to the stand where there was no DUE CARE or DUE DILIGENCE. they weren't thinking before acting, and they weren't even checking if anyone was stealing. There were no FORENSIC capabilities. All of our INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY could have been stolen, and our PRIVACY was gone. We had to scream at the church to get some INTERATIONAL COOPERATION so we could IMPORT more vegies. They are a THIRD PARTY so we had to take certain precautions. We followed import laws, but wrote ETHICS for everything they didn't cover.
